                <h2>Gender Disparities due to lack of Sex Ed</h2>
                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic caused worldwide school closures that impacted 180 crore students, 32 crore of whom are in India. Many of these adolescents may never go back to school, the resulting impact of which will be significant. Girls, especially, are at a higher risk of dropping out.

                    Barriers to girls’ education existed even before Covid-19 but with classrooms moving online, a lack of agency and access to technology has exacerbated their disadvantage. Although the 12 years to 19 years age group comprises 32% of the country’s total internet users, access is not equal. Only 33% of all internet users in the county are women.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Myths and misconceptions along with a lack of resources cause adolescents to adopt unscientific and unhygienic menstrual hygiene practices. This can adversely impact their sexual and reproductive health, while the stigma around menstruation may cause severe anxiety and shame.

                    Data from the 2015-’16 National Family Health Survey-4 shows that 52% of women aged 15 years to 24 years in rural areas did not use modern menstrual hygiene methods.
                    
                    According to the findings from the three-state rapid assessment study by the Population Foundation of India, in April-May 2020, a little more than half of the young girls interviewed reported having an unmet need for sanitary pads. Government schemes for menstrual hygiene are generally linked to schools and without this essential lifeline, girls today have severely limited access to modern menstrual health products.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Comprehensive sexuality education plays a critical role in equipping adolescents to successfully and safely navigate the transition through adolescence.

                    Ensuring that teachers and parents are able to improve interpersonal interactions with adolescents can help in creating spaces for dialogue that are free from bias or stigma. This, in turn, might be the most sustainable way to facilitate better uptake of services and improve outcomes in adolescent sexual and reproductive health overall wellbeing.</p>
